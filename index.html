      <p>Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "Angels come to you in succession by night and day and all of them get together
        at the time of the Fajr and `Asr prayers. Those who have passed the night with you (or stayed with
        you) ascend (to the Heaven) and Allah asks them, though He knows everything about you, well, "In
        what state did you leave my slaves?" The angels reply: "When we left them they were praying and
        when we reached them, they were praying."
